    Symmetric key encipherment, also known as symmetric encryption or private-key encryption, is a cryptographic technique where the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. There are several types of symmetric key encipherment methods, each with its own characteristics and use cases:

        <li>
            <b>Block Ciphers:</b> Block ciphers are a type of symmetric encryption that processes data in fixed-size blocks, typically 64 or 128 bits. The most well-known block cipher is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES operates on blocks of data and uses a fixed key size (128, 192, or 256 bits). It applies a series of mathematical transformations to encrypt and decrypt data. Block ciphers are highly efficient and secure when used with a strong key.
        </li>
        <li><b>Stream Ciphers: </b>Unlike block ciphers, stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, making them suitable for real-time communication and data streaming. Stream ciphers generate a continuous stream of key bits, which are combined with the plaintext data to produce the ciphertext. The RC4 algorithm is an example of a widely used stream cipher. Stream ciphers are known for their speed and low computational overhead.
        </li>
        <li><b>Feistel Networks:</b> Feistel networks are a structure used in some block ciphers, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES). In a Feistel network, the data block is divided into two halves, and a series of rounds are performed on each half using a subkey derived from the main encryption key. These two halves are then combined to produce the ciphertext. Feistel networks provide a way to iteratively apply cryptographic operations and are known for their security and simplicity.
